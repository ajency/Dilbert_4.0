<p>Hi {{$name}}<br /><br />
We see that Dilbert has logged your total hours this week as: {{$violation_data['rule_key_fields']['total_hrs_in_week']}} / {{$violation_data['rule_rhs']['total_week_hours']}} - i.e. <b>{{$violation_data['meta']['time_difference']}} short</b> of the required time. It may be a one-off week, but just a small note to let you know what we think, as also laid out in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B17ClWYMGibaMHZiWnE4TEp3WlE">Ajency.in Handbook</a>.<br /><br /></p>

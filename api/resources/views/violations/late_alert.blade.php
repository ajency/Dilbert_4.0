<p>Hi {{$name}}<br /><br />
We see that Dilbert has logged your start time as: {{$violation_data['rule_key_fields']['start_time']}}. It may be a one-off day, but just a small note to let you know what we think, as also laid out in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B17ClWYMGibaMHZiWnE4TEp3WlE">Ajency.in Handbook</a>.<br /><br />
"Start your day any time after 9.30 am and end by 8:30 pm. We suggest starting the day <b><u>latest by 11 am</u></b>. There may be days when you want to start your day late but donâ€™t make it a regular practice. For very simple reason, we work in a team. A team where each person is dependent on the other, so there has to be an overlap of at least 80% of your time. While it is okay some times, please don't make it a regular practice".</p>
